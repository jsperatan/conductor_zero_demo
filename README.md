This code is a frontend HTML file and a backend JavaScript file that work together to create a payment processing application. The frontend file has a form for users to input their originating account information, while the backend file handles the API calls to an external payment processing service.

The documentation for this code should include the following:

1. Installation instructions: The user should be able to install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
2. Setup instructions: The user should be able to set up the application by running `node backend.js` in the project directory.
3. Usage instructions: The user should be able to use the application by opening `frontend.html` in a web browser and inputting their originating account information into the form.
4. Error handling: The documentation should include any potential errors that may occur during the payment processing process, such as invalid API keys or insufficient funds.
5. Testing: The documentation should include instructions for testing the application, including any necessary setup and cleanup steps.
6. Security considerations: The documentation should include any security considerations that need to be taken into account when using this code, such as data encryption and API key management.
7. Contribution guidelines: The documentation should include guidelines for contributing to the project, including coding standards and pull request procedures.
